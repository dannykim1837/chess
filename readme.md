## Overview

**Project Title**: Chess game

**Project Description**: 
- The Chess Game Implementation in C++ project aims to create a fully functional console-based chess game for two players. It features an 8x8 board with all standard chess pieces, enforcing rules and special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. The game accurately detects check and checkmate conditions, providing real-time feedback. It includes a user-friendly console interface for displaying the board and prompting player moves. Developed incrementally with thorough testing at each stage, the project ensures stability and correctness. Comprehensive documentation will detail the design, implementation, and usage, showcasing advanced C++ programming and object-oriented design principles.

**Project Goals**: 
- The primary goals of the Chess Game Implementation in C++ project are to create a fully functional, console-based chess game where two players can engage in standard gameplay. This includes implementing all chess rules and mechanics, such as valid piece movements, capturing, and special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. The game will accurately detect check and checkmate conditions, providing real-time feedback to the players. A user-friendly console interface will display the chessboard, prompt player moves, and update game status. The project will follow an incremental development approach with rigorous testing to ensure stability and correctness. Comprehensive documentation will detail the design, implementation, and usage, including a user guide and technical documentation. Ultimately, this project aims to demonstrate advanced C++ programming skills and object-oriented design principles.
